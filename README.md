# Adaptive-Signal-Segmentation

My implementation of *An Improved Signal Segmentation Using Moving Average and Savitzky-Golay Filter* (Azami et al. 2012)

## Applications
Used it for a research project where I needed to adaptively segment a collection of biosignals to recognize sleep disorder events.
